# Outlier Detection using Z-Score 📊

This project demonstrates how to detect outliers in a dataset using the **Z-Score method**.
The implementation is done in **Python** using a **Jupyter Notebook**.

---

## 📌 What is Z-Score?
Z-Score measures how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean.

**Formula:**
Z = (x − μ) / σ

Where:
- μ → Mean  
- σ → Standard Deviation  

If `|Z| > threshold` (commonly 3), the data point is considered an **outlier**.
